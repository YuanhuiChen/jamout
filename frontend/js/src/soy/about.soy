			        <p class="about-page__secondary-text">Jamout enables you to easily live stream mini irl events and host music listening parties on the internet with up to 12 friends.</p>

			        <p class="about-page__secondary-text">Getting started is pretty simple: Log in, enter a title and click "stream my webcam". You can then share the 'Link to join' with your friends and also tweet about the stream without leaving the stream page.</p>
					
					<p class="about-page__secondary-text"> I prototyped JamOut in summer 2015 at mostly <a href="babycastles.com">Babycastles</a> after hours Monday nights in NYC. At Babycastles, I live streamed events for <a href="http://pulsewavenyc.tumblr.com/">Pulsewave</a>, a monthly chiptune festival. As I was streaming Pulswave events for my friends, I soon realized that most live streaming web apps weren’t as simple, straightforward or fun to use and there wasn’t one that offered a meaningful and personal experience for users and their close friends. So, I built JamOut that would make it fun to stream events for a few friends that matter.</p>
			      

					<p  class="about-page__secondary-text">I'm currently inviting selected bedroom producers to take JamOut for a spin. It needs a lot of work so please reach out if you encounter any nasty bugs or have suggestions, ideas or need help using JamOut. I want to hear from you so feel free to email me at feelings@jamout.tv</p>
